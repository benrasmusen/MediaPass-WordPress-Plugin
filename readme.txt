Enable subscriptions and billing with ease using the MediaPass plugin. Earn money by charging for your content such as articles, blog posts and video.

== Description ==

MediaPass gives WordPress users an easy way to turn on subscriptions.  With the MediaPass plugin, publishers can earn money by charging for their premium content, without turning on a site-wide registration system or directing end-users to a third party. Sign up for a MediaPass account and use the plugin to manage subscription pages, or even for specific articles or posts, with the click of a button. WYSIWYG buttons are added to your content window to provide an easy way to insert subscriptions to any chosen content on your website.  Merchant accounts are not required for websites using MediaPass.  Integrate your MediaPass.com account with your WordPress website and watch your revenue grow.
